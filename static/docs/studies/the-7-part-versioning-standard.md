## Abstract

Standard Semantic Versioning (SemVer) was designed for human-driven, linear software releases. It is fundamentally insufficient for **Recursive Engineering Ecosystems**, where AI agents autonomously modify, build, and deploy dozens of micro-services across various architectures simultaneously. This paper introduces the **Easter Company 7-Part Versioning Standard**, a rigorous identification protocol designed to ensure that every binary in a distributed intelligence mesh is unique and traceable to its exact temporal and environmental origin.

## 1. The Problem: Version Ghosting

In a system where Dexter can build a new version of the `dex-cli` every 15 minutes to fix a minor bug, traditional tags like `1.2.3` become ambiguous. On which machine was it built? Which git branch was active? Was the code committed, or was it a "dirty" build? This ambiguity, known as "Version Ghosting," makes debugging distributed system-wide failures impossible.

## 2. The Protocol

Every service in the Dexter ecosystem MUST utilize the 7-part version label generated by the `dex build` pipeline (`dex-cli/utils/version.go`):

### `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.BRANCH.COMMIT.DATETIME.ARCH`

1.  **Semantic Core (1-3)**: Traditional `Major.Minor.Patch` for API compatibility.
2.  **Branch (4)**: The active git branch (e.g., `main`, `dev`, `feature-vision`).
3.  **Commit (5)**: The short SHA-1 hash of the source code.
4.  **Datetime (6)**: The Unix timestamp or ISO-8601 date of the build start.
5.  **Architecture (7)**: The target CPU/OS architecture (e.g., `linux-amd64`, `darwin-arm64`).

## 3. Implementation in Build Pipeline

During the `Build Phase` (`dex-cli/cmd/build.go`), the standard is enforced via:

- **Source Audit**: The builder captures the git state before compilation.
- **Link-Time Injection**: These variables are injected into the Go/JS binaries using linker flags (`-ldflags`).
- **Version Command**: Every binary is required to implement a `version` subcommand that outputs this exact string.

## 4. Operational Benefits

- **Conflict Resolution**: If two agents deploy conflicting versions of the `event-service`, the log audit can immediately identify which build was triggered first down to the second.
- **Rolling Rollbacks**: The `dex update` command can surgically revert a service to a specific `COMMIT` or `DATETIME` without guesswork.
- **Recursive Stability**: When Dexter builds _itself_ (e.g., `dex build --source`), the version string provides a "Genetic Marker" that allows us to trace the evolution of the AI's engineering capabilities.

## 5. Conclusion

The 7-Part Versioning Standard is more than a labeling convention; it is a **Chain of Custody** for autonomous software. It provides the deterministic foundation required for AI to safely manage its own nervous system.
